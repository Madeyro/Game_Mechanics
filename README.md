Medkit spawns every 30s on random spawn point and heals the player for 30% of his max health.
Medkit can appear either in the center of the labyrint or near enemy spawn points.

Pressing Q triggers a freezing shield that explodes after 5s and freezes enemies. This shield has its own health and energy. If the player kill the enemy, energy value is increased. If energy is full filled, the shield can be activated. When the shield is destroyed (health == 0), the freeze effect will not be activated. 

## (F4) - Ivanicky, 456439

A sentry can be spawned by pressing T. It automatically shoots the enemies, enemies attack it after getting shot by it. After being destroyed, there is a cooldown, otherwise the player can pick it up and place it elsewhere (the base of the sentry staying after it was picked up is on purpose).
